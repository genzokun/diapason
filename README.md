# DIAPASON
## No Man's Sky in-game Music Project

This is a mixed in-game music series of No Man's Sky compossed by 3 volumes where there are different tracks compossed by the math-rock and post-rock band 65daysofstatic from Sheiffield, UK.

The idea was to try keep listening NMS music outside the game, for studing or while driving a car. The project was started on April 2017 with the first release of Vol.1 in YouTube.

What you will find inside this collection is a composition about songs played procedurally in the PS4 game No Man's Sky. Songs are captured directly from the Play Station 4 during a real game.

Diapason Vol.1 and Vol.2 RAW files have analog output sound but Vol.3 is digital output format.
